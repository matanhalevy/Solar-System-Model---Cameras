m : reset cameras to default
o : switch to control of mother ship
p : switch to control of scout ship
l : absolute look at view

x : move step to x+ plane
x + shift : move step to x- plane
y : move step to y+ plane
y + shift : move step to y- plane
z : move step to z+ plane
z + shift : move step to z- plane

k : move step to k+ plane
k + shift : move to step in k- plane
l : move step to l+ plane
l + shift : move to step in l- plane

g: georbit mode, current ship view orbits a planet. by default earth
1-9: while in geoorbit switch planets
w: move further from current planet

to make sure this works optimally on your web browser, open the p2.html in firefox and open about:config page.
- change the security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy boolean value to false.
